# NetKet tests

for testing.

## Contents
- `modunetket.py`: Hilbert space and Ising Hamiltonian helpers (TFIM). 
- `ising_mf.py`: Mean-field (real and complex) variational experiments.

- `ising_ffn_tutorial.py`: i follow the netket tutorial for the 1d ising + a custom S2 -> jax -> gradient calculation.  Comparison with native netket S2



## Notes
- Computations are set to CPU by default (`JAX_PLATFORM_NAME=cpu`) for portability.
